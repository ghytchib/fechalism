    <h2 id="forutanda-1">Forutanda 1 — Origins & Rules</h2>
    <pre class="scripture">
Book of FORUTANDA: beware the fecha virus.

	Forutanda 1:1 “Any estudiante must praise za one and only ugly and moldy Sra Steketee” (FOR OUR COMITEE not religion, FECHALISM and you’re a STEKALORIAN)
“And when Sra Steketee gets adressed as Srta, extra credit for la participacion.”
“The ancient ‘origins’ of Ms steketee starts in the next chapter
Expecto Patronum!
Expelliaramous!
(Since we're casting spells, I thought l'd add some from Harry Potter.)
Forutanda 1:2 “One must turn za whole packet en zis class”
The origins of German sub will be discussed later

“The ONE AND ONLY Capitulo Cinco creates the start of the Stek lore. In which we discuss the veins and roots of la fecha”

“Cual es la fecha de hoy?” starts the true meaning of fecha. With american enunciation DIBHUU*HEWBJ throughout”


Forutanda 1:3 “This was ze start of the start of the gridlington of ms stekte.”
 Basically a gridlington is a form of hatred towards another person that is kinda unwarranted and obsessive for no reason and may be from a small incident. And this gridlington was massive’’
“Pineapple on pizza and srta are both receiving gridlington”

Forutanda 1:4 (plz forgive me the ghos of la fecha is upon us helppppp and also attend bilbel study por favor by josie and som (sorry we had to put in a promotion add in here)
	Forutanda 1:5 “Escucha por la song de nek classroom”
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

TU NOMBRE is tanthat tan grande which it’s.   P.R. pure
POR EL LA NEKKKKK
no no no it’s not a BIY it’s a gurllll nyeah I’m divorced yes
remember the song for later-
“NO! Las canciones have the consequences sh and rules and it is you sing”

The rules of las canciones

	1	You must sing loud and proud when the marker is at your face
	2	If you don’t participate..NO POINTS DEE PARTICIPATION POR TU
	3	always allow jumping over tables aha
	4	lastly, only pop rock music is allowed (I’m reading the script)

Forutanda 1:6 “I as srta gave away my neck to get boyfriend… and I got 5 chins in return which slowly merged into 1 long slope of plump skin and flesh”

so what that MEAN YOU CAN do

Is obviously silly diddy: la fecha de capitol 6 of bilbel in the book of Forutanda 1:1.. where YU PRAZE ZA UNO AND ONLY STKERE :

“You are allowed to be fat and big with no visible jawline under any conditions”

Forutanda 1:7 “ATHENM DE LA SENORITA DE LA sTEKETEEEEEEE” 

(to the tune of star spangled banner) 
Oh say can you smell, stektee’s awful fumes
What so despondently hailed at third hours forthcoming
Who’s trauma and great pain, through the 50 minutes
Oe’r the laptops did peer, was the FECHA OH LORD
And the stek’s demand for notes, the white boards and pain
Gave proof soon there after, that the fecha was back
O say does that board read, CUAL ES LA FECHA HOHY
Oe’r the desks ready for tests, in their rows or the columns

On the desk did she perch through the fog of the fecha
Where the stek’s demanding voice, calls for test and SIENTENSE
What is that which breeze, that stek’s nasty fragrance
As it grows, oh the stench, as the stek does approach you
Now we put up the books, make the stek’s awful border
In our hand is NOT A RED OR YELLOW PEN
Tis the test of preterito- oh low be them grades
Oe’r the class of the FECHA, and the las cancoines dee neck
…

THE WORLD collapses and then brings the conjugation…


BILBEL DE FECHA HAS BEEN FORMATTED WE GOING TO GRAD SCHOOL PEPOLE


but what’s happened????? How did the Fecha virus pandemic start?

To understand the implications and the cause, we must look at the following verses 1:8 and 1:9 showing the story and then the impacts.


“Our fecha is THE fecha, so read it, learn it, live it)


Here comes the harp.. Is that a harp??? Who is that?


Forutanda 1:8

The vermeer..Heheheheheheh i’m gonna harp on you😈
because of waffle wind ensemble

“When Vermeer said she’s gonna harp on the percussion, the vibration of the pluck has caused more than just a pluck…”

“When the security guard of OFSUH PAMA flings by the table hearing that plucking.. ohhh ho hohoh ohhh

So Ms Vermeer caused the plucking epidemic in which Ms steketee had found out about it”

“AAAAAAAH MI FECHA! WHAT IS THE *pluck* FECHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH”

This caused el Stek to go on ZA RAMPAGEE
and she never lista chewing gum for ZAGOODD BREATH

“this caused implications for an infection to el estudiante por the deportes JOAQUIN (they/them/hakeem)”

“the virus went to every corner of the school and causing a new variant of virus which was a SYNDROME! FECHA Tourette’s with FECHA tic!!!”

This is how the plucking of simply waffle wind ensemble SHUSHED the entire crowd. 
Forutanda 1:9 “Ze song de la lista un de mi steketee lo siento”✌️
“
La fecha de lista la lista en mi empacto mucho…
Tu nombre es no bueno no empacto de mi lista fecha..
La FECHA DE MI NOMBRE!!
EMPACTO DE MI ATOMBRE!!
La su no siento chu chu chu de ofsuh palma, turning them streets creating griddle, chu chu chu za palma goes./
LA FECHA DE MI NOMBRE’ 
EMPACTO DE MI ATOMBRE
Lu lu lu la fecha virus las muchas grandes estandas empactas!!!
OOOOOOOOOH fechocytoko la muchastoglasktemukaste, la fecha DEEE MIO NOMBREEEE..
The impacts of the fecha virus listed in an entire song, still yet to be translated for ultimate understanding of the impacts..

La Translacion translate EL vocab😘™️ powered by WordReference™️

“The IMPACTS EN INGLES
The fecha virus continued to spread knocking down and deteriorating the town de mi listan. The town was nearly empty, no steketee warriors roaming the stekestreers, the virus had contained nearly the entire populacion….”

“The FECHA Tourette’s recieved lots of gridlington porque es muy muy NONLOSTA ASNIWHSWN E E ETH ESTÁ TU ESTATS TU TU ESTAS ”





Forutanda 1:10 “How the phone pouch temporarily saved the world from Fecha virus in a recovery mode”

When Ms Fecha was like 
NOOOOOOO LOS CELULARES EN LA POUCH
“She had wisdom in calling out names of those who didn’t have their celular in the pouch”
GUYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS IM GOING TO HAVE TO START CALLING OUT NYEAMS OF PEOPLE WHO DONT HAVE PHONE IN THE POUCH

“•••••¥¥¥¥¥#]^]€]?\|£this caused people to be disciplined, with less diarios of fechas and this caused a decline”

BUT THEN….

GUYS USE YOUR CELULARES FOR YOUR PLANNNERS NYEA

“But nobody listen to za Stek rules being za rebellion”
“Praise za stek de mi la praisada una onlañi”

and Fecha virus had a spike again

take a look at this 


“You see the original spike was when we discussed the first infection of joaquin and then it stayed through a high lower when the tic variant arose” 

“The dip was when the phone pouch laws were enforced for anti-quarantine purposes”

“But then they arose after the REBELLION OF POUCHES”

so to recap: Fecha virus arose, but phone pouches decreased them, But then the rebellion of pouches happens and za stek forces were defeated against the forces of la estudiantes de 5th hour
FORUTANDA 1:11 “Additional stekalorian stek star rules of the book of Forutanda”

	•	You are permitted to be a stekalorian under the fecha bible, however any sensed distrust will result in you being KICKED OFF of la committee specialllllo and you will be considered an enemy, or a Joaqalorian (ruled by el primero infectee of the fecha virus)

After the fall of the principle of Stek Star (not stekalaorians we got revived) after the loss during the Grand Lorian War, we now shift it to the moral aspect through the fecha bible. There are the updated los rules to be permitted in the stekalorian bible community


NO TRAITORNESS, BE A FECHA LOYALIST, AND ALWAYS RESPECT ZA ONE AND ONLY STEKETEE 


ADDITIONALLLY…you may be of homo sexilatily because we are all inclusive comitee way of life

	•	also no disrespectful to other religion this is not a cult its a way of life

	•	You must adress Kian as a child

	•	You are required to look for the 12 traits of a narcissist in a partner!!!

Forutanda 1:12 “Equality con la FECHA is a key to the class. Keep it secret, keep it safe.”

First we must develop some moral ideals for this point. 

“As said by the steketee, not all in this clas share an equal leval of intelligence”

There are four clear categories. 

	•	The Fechalists (aka Joaqalorians) who are the enemies (traitors to the group or ones who hate our group, or those who worship HAKEEM THE INFECTEE! - the name stekalorians use against joaquin the leader)
	•	The Dumbutt
	•	The “normals” or the neutral people
	•	The one’s who worship the steketee
(bonus for extra credit: The Stekalorians)
	•	REMEMBER: ms stektee is not in a grupo porque ella makes up all the groups and she is the divine being, the holy fecha. She is the only divine being.

“Over each category, we must not skimp upon”

The fechalists. The one’s who fought in the fecha war with joaquin, attempting to infect the world with the fecha virus. Although they and their grades are currently low…

THEY WILL BE BACK

PRAISE THE FECHA

Joaquin will ROUSE the fighters once more, and the war de la fecha Y PRETERITO will begin si si si

Mi hermano del Fecha, compredes?

In addition, we have the dumbutt which is the idiots who have no idea what is going on
Introduce the “stekthink” in which all affected by it find a certain weakness in their brains. 

Unable to preform basic functions, they huddle in the corner mumblin Fecha fecha fecha as their brains melt

Want to know if your friend has been drawn in by the stekthink? 

Contact me, number FECHAFECHAFECHA-FECHAFECHAFECHA-STEKFECHAFECHAFECHA

(freak singing fecha in the background)

Next we have the normals. 

They’re not important. 

MOVING ON

The one’s who worship the steketee. 

In the dep dark o the fecha the stekalorians aka the ones who worship the steketee, are the ones who get the tarea done. 

They neither resisted or accepted the fecha virus, choosing instead to protec the steketee and wait upon her to grade the food project. 

And finally, the holy stekalorians. 

Of us, only so far are ^Y2^, @T#, %&(4  and %(TRIW (if i say our actual name’s we’re gonna be cooked)

WE ARE THE TRUTH OF THE FECHA

Of us are the conteplators of diario, the examiners of the stek culture and the decompression of the true meaning of “fecha”.

This is the creed. Not a word will be spoken of this outside our holy covenant. This is our word, our belief. 

THIS IS THE WAY

(fecha fecha feacha fecha fecha fecha fecha…)



Forutanda 2:0.5 “clase, open your computers and go to quizlet!”


(HERE ON ZA QUIZLET, WE STUDY THE WAR BETWEEN THE FECHA GROUP, STEK STARS (now known as simply Stekalorians post-revival and no Stek Star agency) AND THE FECHALISTS JOAQALORIAN)


THE SEQUENTIAL ORDER OF THE WAR CALLED
THE GRAND LORIAN WAR

	•	Secondary Bulb Battle between Ms Graff and Srta Steketee
	•	Instigation of Yakob between Ms Jacobs, Graff, and Srta
	•	Stek Star Battle between (Stek Star) Stekalorians and Joaqalorians
	•	Battle of Tos between Mr Korienek and The Joaqalorians
	•	Catapult Attacks executed by the Stekalorians on the Joaqalorians (with Joaqalorian resistance forces)
	•	Battle of Mapastek between Ms Mapes and the Stekalorians and interference by the Lakacologists (Lakaka and Ms Graff)
	•	Muzzle-Lisp Battle between Krableg (With Lisp) and Ms Muzio
	•	Fecha Muskatos Battle between the Stekalorians and Krableg
	•	The Great Reset signaling the end of the war after everyone split up suddenly, moving to new lore

Forutanda 2:1

First, when the stek star agency was founded, we had made an implicit error, in which Joaquin was added. At the time, the aforementioned virus had not spread. Soon after, Hakeem the Infectee had to be kicked out. 


after, “SRTA STEKETEEEEEE YOUR PROJECTOR BULB MADE A BOOOOOOM!”

however…that wasn’t the same 

“Turns out, it was the footsteps of Hakeem the infectee”

SECOND HOUR!!!!!

“and then it started…”

Forutanda 2:2

Sorry for PARTY

“Then what happened was Joaquin sent his troops to march onwards going to inspect the mess!

The army marched toward us”

The main generals for the Fechalists were;

Yamil Yamil 

Colen Dill Pickle

This was all numoerous folllowers of them or people who hated our group, causing us to receive GRIDLINGTON!!! (By Los fechalists)

Our army was lots of small compared to them, with the Stekalorians of STEK STARS 

We didn’t have generals, we just had Stekalorians:

SOM CANAVAGOH
VROOM VEEEEJAY
JOSIE MARKZ
TRY TRAN
ELLIE QUAILS

But then Lakaka decided to join their group ‘no dude you’re so obsessed’

then he was considered a big fechalist, and he grew fond of HAKEEM THE INFECTEE making him an instant JOAQALORIAN

But then THE BULB OF SRTA PROJECTOR ROLLED INTO the hallway!!!!
